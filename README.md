Extensive support for data filtering, with flexible structure for querying both RESTful APIs and oData APIs. Offers a wide choice of UI filter components with state management integrated with Readux. Hooks-based library.
Built around publisher-subscribe pattern where controller should orchestrate the flow between filters and filters consumer, by providing information about where-to-push-filters to filter components, and by providing where-to-listen-for-change information to filters consumer in an easy to use hooks based approach.
